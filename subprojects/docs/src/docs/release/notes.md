### Incremental build uses less memory

Memory usage for up-to-date checking has been improved.
For the gradle/gradle build, heap usage dropped by 60 MB to 450 MB, that is a 12% reduction.

### Build Init plugin uses recommended configurations

The [Build Init plugin](userguide/build_init_plugin.html) now generates build scripts that use the recommended `implementation`, `testImplementation`, and `testRuntimeOnly` configurations instead of `compile`, `testCompile`, and `testRuntime`, respectively, for all build setup types.

## Promoted features

Promoted features are features that were incubating in previous versions of Gradle but are now supported and subject to backwards compatibility.
See the User guide section on the “[Feature Lifecycle](userguide/feature_lifecycle.html)” for more information.

### Java Library Distribution Plugin utilizes Java Library Plugin
